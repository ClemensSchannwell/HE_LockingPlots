This repo contains all the necessary input files and plotting scripts to reproduce all figures shown
in the paper enititled: "A mechanism for reconciling the synchronisation of Hein-
rich events and Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles" by Schannwell et al. 

To run the plotting scripts any version of Python3 is required. To create a plot clone the directory 
and then cd into the desired folder (e.g. Fig01) and simply run "python3 MakeFig01.py." For some of the
plots when you do that, the script will tell you that you need to specify a region and that you can 
choose from Hudson or Kenzie. In this instance use the command "python3 MakeFig01.py -reg Hudson"
